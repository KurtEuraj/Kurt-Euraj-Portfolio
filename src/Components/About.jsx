        I started my journey in Front-End Development in 2020. Through various courses, YouTube videos, and articles, I developed an understanding and intuition for building websites and other UI-related projects. 
        From here, I wanted to evolve in search of new and efficient ways to build upon my craft. Many of the projects and websites i've built, helped me do just that-
        learn cleaner code, best practices, and most importantly, finding solutions to problems. 
        Front-End is an ever-changing and evolving field. With new libraries/frameworks and innovative ways of completing different tasks, a developer's job isn't just about writing/understanding code but also adapting to the modern climate and solving new problems.

        Some of my hobbies include listening to and sometimes making music, Formula One, and Basketball.
        I've always loved watching and playing sports. For as long as I can remember, music has given me a creative outlet and I'm currently learning to play the Electric Guitar.
