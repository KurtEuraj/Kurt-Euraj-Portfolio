      Beginning my journey in Front-End Development in 2020, I delved into courses, YouTube tutorials, and articles, developing a solid understanding of building websites and UI projects. 
      As I progressed, my focus shifted towards refining my skills efficiently, learning cleaner code, adhering to best practices, and finding practical solutions to challenges. 
      Front-End development is ever-evolving, marked by new libraries, frameworks, and innovative approaches. 
      Adapting to this dynamic field, I've learned to navigate and solve problems effectively.

        Some of my hobbies include listening to and sometimes making music, Formula One, and Basketball.
        I've always loved watching and playing sports. For as long as I can remember, music has given me a creative outlet and I'm currently learning to play the Electric Guitar.
