I developed this project in Webflow. The Biggest challenge was getting the data (location coordinates, booking links, phone, etc.) across the site to update based on the location the user selects. To solve this, I created multiple objects that pull data from each Webflow CMS Location and put them in an array. These objects help populate the data across the site and whenever the location is changed, we get the data in that specific location's object. Due to timeline constraints, the project was completed in 2.5 weeks.",

I created an array of location objects derived from our CMS, allowing for efficient organization and real-time updates of location-specific content. Additionally, I integrated Mapbox for interactive maps, contributing to a seamless user experience.",

One of the most important features of the site was the client questionnaire. The main focus was to have all of the questionnaire data automatically go to ClickUp once submitted. Utilizing Make (an automation tool), I was able to designate where inquires go and how they're handled. As well as catch errors and duplicate inquires. This was useful for our existing clients as well. I hadn't used Make before so I was forced to adapt and understand the workflow for this project.",

The workflow was configured to generate folders for new clients and store inquiries for existing clients, while also preventing errors and duplicate submissions. This implementation streamlined our processes, aiding the team in organizing tasks and managing new clients.",
